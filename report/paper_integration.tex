  \section*{Model explanation}
    The model is conceptually zero-dimensional, and the initial conditions consider the minimal cell concentration recorded by~\cite{scalco2014dynamics} as gametogenesis trigger.
    Cell numbers and available nitrogen are expressed as abundance and concentration, respectively.

    The simulation starts with a cell population ($P$) that enters the sexual reproduction phase after reaching a threshold value of a few thousand cells per ml (see~\cite{scalco2014dynamics}).
    During this phase of variable length, the population stops growing and experiences a prolonged burst of gametogenesis-induced mortality.
    Within the same span, a $P$ fraction will undergo gametogenesis and generate an offspring population ($F_{1}$) that will start to grow the moment ($t_{F_{1}I}$) it appears.
    After $t_{AE}$ days, the growth arrest will end and $P$ will resumes its growth alongside $F_{1}$.
    During the entire course of the simulation (set to ten days) cell growth is modulated by competition over nitrogen and cell size via an allometric relationship (see~\cite{d2010time}).
    \textbf{Fig.~\ref{fdyn}} shows the relative variation of allometric growth (\textbf{plot {\color{blue}\textit{a}}}).

    A fundamental assumption, discussed later in the text, is that parental and daughter cells share a common, exclusive space, so that only $P$ and $F_{1}$ compete for N made available in such space.
    This assumption is translated in the model as a decrease in growth rate as the total population ($F_{1} + P$) converges toward the carrying capacity, set as the total nitrogen content of initial parental cells.

    To understand better how event timing and response amplitudes impact over $F_{1}$ recruitment success, we compared simulation outputs across selected parameters range.
    Our selected parameters are the $P$ fraction that will generate $F_{1}$ ($\alpha$), gametogenesis-induced extra mortality of parental cells ($m$), duration of the growth arrest ($t_{AE}$), and growth rates ratio among parental and initial cells ($r_{P}:r_{F_{1}}$)
    We deployed an interactive version of the model at the URL \url{https://arfalas.shinyapps.io/pns_toy/}, code and figures are available on \url{https://github.com/bhym/Stec} ({\color{red} currently private})

  \section*{Model description}
    Parental ($P$) and offspring ($F_{1}$) dynamics are defined as ODE:\@
    %
    \begin{align}
      \frac{dP}{dt}     &= \kappa \mu_{P} P - \delta P \\
      \frac{dF_{1}}{dt} &= \kappa \mu_{F_{1}} F_{1}
    \end{align}
    %
    where $\kappa$ is the competition for N, defined as
    \[
      1 - \frac{{[N]}_{t}}{1.2{[N]}_{t=0}}
    \]
    with 
    \[
      [N_{t}] = {[P]}_{t} {[N]}_{P} + {[F_{1}]}_{t} {[N]}_{F_{1}}
    \]

    $\mu_{P}$ and $\mu_{F_{1}}$ are defined as
    \[
      \mu_{P} =
        \begin{cases}
          0                    & \mbox{if } t <    t_{AE} \\
          \lambda_{P}(t) r_{P} & \mbox{if } t \geq t_{AE}
        \end{cases}
      \qquad;\qquad
      \mu_{F_{1}} = 
        \begin{cases}
          0                            & \mbox{if } t <    t_{F_{1}I} \\
          \lambda_{F_{1}}(t) r_{F_{1}} & \mbox{if } t \geq t_{F_{1}I}
        \end{cases}
    \]
    with $\lambda_i(t)$ representing allometric scaling on length ($L$), defined as
    \[
      \lambda_{i}(t) = 0.25 + 0.04 L_{i}(t) - 0.0005 L_{i}{(t)}^{2}
    \]
    Length dynamics are based on cell's age ($a$) and are defined by the rule
    \[
      L_{i}(t) = L_{0,i} - 0.1 a(t) \hspace{8mm}\text{with $i$ either $P$ or $F_{1}$}
    \]
    Age is counted from the appearance of the population, and does not increase during GA.\@

    Finally, $\delta$ is an extra mortality term defined as
    \[
      \begin{cases}
        m & \mbox{if } t < t_{AE} \\
        0 & \mbox{if } t > t_{AE}
      \end{cases}
    \]
    The parameters values and ranges are reported in \textbf{Table~\ref{tbl1}}.
